      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am a science teacher at an inner-city high school in Dallas, Texas. I enjoy hanging out with my husband and our cats, which is the only thing that we have really been able to do due to the pandemic.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Plano, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I used to have hobbies, but now I am a teacher, which sucks up all of my time. I used to play music, go to local concerts, read books for fun, cook for fun, bake, host parties, travel, but now I am utterly boring.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If we are talking dream jobs, I would like to be the U.S. Ambassador to The Bahamas. If anyone knows who is going to be president in 25 years, let me know so I can befriend them and secure the appointment.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Dallas, Texas just north of downtown.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Working as a classroom teacher is not sustainable, so I am wanting to build my skills as a web developer so I have a clear and strong exit plan for when I reach my breaking point in public education. I also think that there are numerous new opportunities in EdTech and I like the idea of using my experience as an educator to build tools to increase efficiency./p>
